__Question #1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Senâ€™s definition to include the idea of complexity?__
Sen pointed out that development should be more than increase of average incomes. Whether people are able to have more opportunities and freedom should be included as well. 
Barder defined development as a property of economic and social system itself, which means it is not purely the sum of well-being of people in it. It is the development of different parts in the society that can provide people fulfilling lives.
