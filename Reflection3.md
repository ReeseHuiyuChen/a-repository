# Data Reflection 3

__Question #1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?__

> Sen pointed out that development should be more than increase of average incomes. Whether people are able to have more opportunities and freedom should be included as well. Barder defined development as a property of economic and social system itself, which means it is not purely the sum of well-being of people in it. It is the development of different parts in the society that can provide people fulfilling lives.


__Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?__

> Thwaites attempted to make an electronic toaster from scratch. He first bought a cheapest toaster and then break it up to see different parts. 
After nine months’ effort, he made one out but the toaster burned after working for 5 second. According to Thwaites, he called this project as a “partial success”. The project indicates even to make a cheap toaster from zero, significant amount of technologies and knowledge are needed. 
Supplies from different fields are necessary, therefore the idea of development should for all, not a single firm.


__Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?__

> Barder considers the past 50 years in the most successful in prompting social developments, including reducing poverty, increasing incomes, increasing rate of education etc. 
However, the models still are not able to explain the disparity in levels of development of different countries. 
The missing components of the models might have better explanations for the difference.


__Question #4.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?__

> Jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. He helped with designing a nozzle for a soap powder factory. Instead of designing one from scratch, he took ten existing nozzles and tested each one and adjusted the shape according to the results. 
After about forty generations, it turns out that the final version was hundreds of times more efficient than the original one.


__Question #5.  What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?__

> Complex adaptive system means that the normal state of the affairs are actually not simple and linear, but are complex and non-linear. They are hard to predict in detail but can be predicted broadly, they have emergent properties. More specifically, this means that the system was the result of interactions of individuals in it. Besides, unlike economic models, they tend towards complexity and do not tend toward equilibrium.


__Question #6.  Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?__

> Haile Selassie was the last emperor of feudal dynasty of Ethiopia. He had secret police to report every detail about ministers and officials who were working under him. Based on what they said, they might be prompted or punished. Also, all the ideas and judgments were made only by the emperor. Anyone tried to report the poverty in the countryside might get himself in trouble, as this was not what the emperor want to know. The emperor controlled what people say and do to suppress the possibility of a social change.


__Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?__

> Engineering was outperformed by evolution under this environment. The firms and industries have to adapt themselves to an era like this. Besides, as predictions on a precise scale will not work in the complex adaptive system, engineering solutions no longer work. Isomorphic mimicry originally means animals try to disguise themselves as more dangerous than they actually are in order to confuse their predators. Under this situation, it means the organizations which look complete are are able to function do not function properly. 


__Question #8.  What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?__

> He means that people should not just accept whatever the evolution process brings to us. If humans are smart enough, we might be able to change the outcome of the process. Borlaug developed a kind of wheat plant which was high-yield and disease-resistant, which saved hundreds of millions of people from starvation. What Borlaug did was called Green Revolution.
