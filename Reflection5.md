# Data Reflection 5

The advent of big data and data science does enable people to enter a new era. According to Kitchin, the paradigm of science has changed from third generation computational science to the fourth generation, which is exploratory science. This means that from now on, science will involved intensively with statistical exploration and experiment, and it becomes something different compare to traditional science. 

Anderson would suggests theories produced by traditional scientific methods are no longer needed, because big data is able to provide meaningful and insightful result for many complicated situations, even if it can only give a vague correlation, not a precise relation. For example, Anderson referred to research of Dyche (2012). Dyche describes a case of a retail shop discovering a possibly ignored correlation for products end up in shoppers’ baskets when studying its purchase transactions. Changing products placement based on the correlation, the shop has a 16% increase in revenue per basket in the first month. Unlike traditional research methods, the research is carried out without any hypothesis. In addition, the one who did this research might not be an expert, but just the shop keeper who intended to increase profit of the shop. With a data analytics software and purchase transactions, anyone who is able to understand a statistic or data visualization can interpret the research result. Even deeper understandings are not necessary, as only with the conclusion people are able to take actions to achieve the ends. What’s more, as the result is obtained from real data instead of experimental ones, it is very valid and reliable. With spread of making use of big data, it would become a science which is accessible to people who are not experts.

Besides, realization of correlation instead of actual relation might be a progress. Interactions between different variables is complicated, as what Barder points out as “complex adaptive system”. This means that the normal state of the affairs are actually not simple and linear, but are complex and non-linear. They are hard to predict in detail but can be predicted broadly, they have emergent properties. More specifically, this means that the system was the result of interactions of individuals in it. With use of data science, it can be discovered that these results are more like spontaneous, not following any certain rule. In fact, as the complex system, the world is more “gray” other than black or white. It is very difficult to assert the exist of any absolute. Therefore, I believe using big data to produce correlations is more objective, and leads to deeper understanding of the world we are living in.

Of course, I also think we should not just cast traditional science away. Like the example of Large Hadron Collider given by West indicates, data and theory should collaborate with and make up of each other. If it is inefficient to iterate through a large amount of data, it is wise to use theory to predict and focus on a specific part in order to produce a more precise and valid conclusion.
