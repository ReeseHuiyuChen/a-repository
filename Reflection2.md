# Data Reflection 2

According to Anderson, big data and related technology have ended the era for theories. 
Instead, large amount of data are processed and analysed for possible correlations in the dataset.
On the other hand, the traditional scientific method, which depends on data obtained from experiments to falsify the hypotheses, has become obsolete. 
The huge change in research method, or measurement, has led to revolution of science as well.
The idea that scientific research will depends on Big Data is named empiricist epistemology, just like how people did research before Renaissance. 
It enables the process of research to be easier, and the results are more reliable, valid and practical.

For example, Dyche (2012) describes a case of a retail shop discovering a possibly ignored correlation for products end up in shoppers’ baskets when studying its purchase transactions. 
Changing products placement based on the correlation, the shop has a 16% increase in revenue per basket in the first month.

Clearly, the research is carried out without any hypothesis. 
In addition, the one who did this research might not be an expert, but just the shop keeper who intended to increase profit of the shop.
With a data analytics software and purchase transactions, anyone who is able to understand a statistic or data visualization can interpret the research result. 
Even deeper understandings are not necessary, as only with the conclusion people are able to take actions to achieve the ends.
What’s more, as the result is obtained from real data instead of experimental ones, it is very valid and reliable. 
But it should be noticed that the result is not representative, as a drawback, because preferences of customers in different shops might vary largely.

The example above is related to business, but in fact data science is useful in many other research fields. 
Besides natural, life, physical and engineering science, data science helps out in social science as well.
Positivist approach relies on data from social behaviors to explain and summarize a specific phenomenon. 
Social science like sociology, economics, political science and geography can all apply to Positivism.
For Positivists, the Big Data enables them to develop “more sophisticated, wider-scale, finger-grained models of human life.” 
Also, they are able to obtain up-to-date data for research, and there are more opportunities to testify their models, which might even able to prompt the change of government policy.

However, the drawback of involving Big Data in social science research is worth noticing as well. 
Just like what Blumenstock worried in his humbler data science, only data is processed during the analysis, ironically humans behind the scene have been dehumanized.
Individualism would be ignored, and even people with different idea will be interpreted in the same way. 
Without further study on individuals, the reliability and validity of the research can still be improved.
Data science, on its own, would be beneficial on summarizing theories or models on a macro scale; 
but in order to interpret meanings behind the numbers, studies on individuals are necessary as well.
