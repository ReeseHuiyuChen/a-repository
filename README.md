# Self Introduction

Hi everyone, I am Huiyu Chen, or you can just call me Reese.

I deferred lat semester, so this is literally my first semester at W&M. I am really looking forward to going to the campus.

I am now in Shenzhen, a city in Southern China. It is usually warm in winter, which I appreciate.
