From color of the plots of differences, it is reasonable to consider that difference of mean is able to produce the best result, for its color is the closest to 0. The other two seems have deeper color, which indicates greater difference between predicted and actual. However, the 3D plots are quite similar, which means disparities between the three methods might be ignorable. That is, the three methods produce similar results.
