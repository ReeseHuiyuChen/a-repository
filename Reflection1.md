## Informal Response: Reflection_1

According to Blumenstock, the application of data science has been too aggressive. 
Though one of the initial intentions was help to distribute humanitarian aids for the poor, based on the map created by collecting smartphone data, 
the use of data science might still get too far and brings some drawbacks.

Some of the pitfalls are pointed out by Blumenstock as well. The application of digital credits is one. 
Data on people’s history of phone use is treated as way to assess whether people are able to repay the loan.
But it turns out that these loans can hardly benefit people and might lead them into the poverty traps.
If being marked as discredited, the record can be left for decades to further prevent people from borrowing money.
Another problem is validity of those data.
For example, making a map indicating area where the poor live based on satellite images of thatched roofs might be not accurate, 
because some people may try to camouflage their roofs in order to get the aid.
Besides, in most situations the poor are marginalized and their real conditions are not represented by the data. 
This is due to their lack of methods to advocate for their needs.
In addition, privacy becomes a problem. 
Private companies which control most of the technology are not regulated, and it is possible for them to use personal data to trade for profits.

To prevent the application of data science going too far, Blumenstock suggests several aspects to improve. 
For enhancing validity, he suggested to use data science alongside with existing methods, which are able to prove each other.
Besides, the use of data should be adjusted according to in which situation it is used. 
For example, as Blumenstock mentioned in the passage, in the case of digital credits, people’s lending decisions varies in different regions.
That is, the research algorithm should be contextualized for it to function.

For ‘good intent’ in the first statement, I think first it should be clarified what is good intent for people in different stances. 
Like Blumenstock stated, data related to artificial-intelligence area are generally controlled by private companies.
From standpoint of these company owners, to make profits as much as possible and develop their companies would be their good intents.
But for the government, it might intend to use data science to solve humanitarian issues throughout the country, 
or even the world, like producing a map to match resources to people in poverty.
For me, data science should be used for people who are really in need, but not for the wealthy to become wealthier. 
Though just having this good intent is not enough, as the statement suggests, it is this intent that prompts people to act and to discover where to improve.
Clearly, people can not and should not be represented just by some numbers, but there are improvements to make the numbers more related to human. 
Blumenstock referred to a two-pronged research in Haiti, in which the researchers are comparing phone data and survey data.
